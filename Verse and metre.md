# Verse and metre
?
Each line of poetry is called a 'verse', which should not be confused with sentences. When a sentence carries on over the end of a line, it is called enjambment, which poets may use for artistic reasons. The rhythmic structure of each verse is called metre. IT may consist of any number of metric feet.
