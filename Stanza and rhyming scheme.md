# Stanza and rhyming scheme
?
Studying poetry is, to some extent, a study of prosody, which refers to the patterns of rhythm and sounds used in poetry. To find patterns, look to the stanza. Stanzas are to poetry what paragraphs are to prose. They give the reader a sense of structure and organisation. When studying the structure of poems, you may notice the use of rhyme, sometime within a verse (internal rhyme) or at the end of each verse. Many poems, however, do not rhyme at all. Free verse does not rhyme. Blank verse, which follows a certain metre such as iambic pentameter, also does not rhyme.
