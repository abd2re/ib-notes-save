# Setting
?
The setting is where the story is set, is important for reflecting the atmosphere of the story. In this sense the setting can act as a mirror of the character's problems. It can also act as a mold in shaping the characters' personalities. Authors may also engage readers by depicting a setting, which is different from the readers' own world. Finally you may want to consider the degree to which characters are alienated by their surroundings. Alienation is a common conflict between character and settings.
