Let's begin by explaining the Minimax search algorithm because it is the most straight-forward from the two algorithms in this experiment. The Minimax Search Algorithm is a graph decision algorithm used, in this case, to offer move candidates for a game-playing Connect Four algorithm. It's name comes from its goal to _minimize_ the score of its opponent while _maximizing_ our own score at every move made \cite{.
