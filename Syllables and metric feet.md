# Syllables and metric feet
?
Every word in English consists of one or more syllables. A syllable is the unit of sound, when speaking a word, which usually has one vowel. Syllables provide the beats of the rhythm of poem. Some syllables are stressed, while others are naturally unstressed. When analyzing poetry you can look for the clusters and patterns of stresses in a line. Each unit of stressed and unstressed sound is known as a metric foot.
