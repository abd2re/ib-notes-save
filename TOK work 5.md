# To what extent should the pursuit of scientific knowledge be value free ?

The extent at which the pursuit of scientific knowledge be value free deals with the question that to what extent to which scientific research should be pursued without being influenced by personal values and biases. It is asking whether scientists should strive to be completely objective and value-free in their research, or whether it is inevitable that personal values and biases will play a role in shaping the scientific process.  This question is important because it speaks to the very nature of scientific inquiry and its relationship to the broader social and cultural contexts in which it takes place. Science has played an important role in shaping our understanding of the world and advancing our knowledge, but it is not immune to the influence of personal values, biases, and cultural assumptions.
