To what extent are you still the same person that you were before you begin the TOK class ?

Bias:: prejudice, favoritism, unfairness, partiality

Identity:: how a person, group, or nation sees themselves in relation to other people, groups, nations, ideas, and the world

Contingent:: only true under certain conditions, and dependent on other things.

Culture:: the shared ideas, beliefs, customs and practices of a community or society.

Perception: an awareness of something in and through the mind

We live in an age in which self-identity and self-estime are regarded as crucial to our health and well-being at the same time we are invited to take part into self-improvement programs, and the selfie is perhaps the fastest growing genre in photograph.
