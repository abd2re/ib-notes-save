To narrow down my choice of object, I have to base my exhibition on one of the core or 5 optional themes. Object must be from the real world. They should be tangible, pre-existing and none generic. You have to choose objects that are on personal interest. The TOK subject guide clearly state that for objects existing in a particular time and place, this include virtual spaces.
