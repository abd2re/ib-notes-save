This image is a photograph taken in 1945 of General Leslie Groves and J. Robert Oppenheimer, the fathers of the Manhattan Project, they are seen on the ground zero of the Trinity Test where the first atomic bomb has been tested, in New Mexico. In an effort to stop the war with Japan, the Americans decided to create a weapon of mass destruction but the consequence of making such weapon would be other nations could use it for control and can lead nuclear Armageddon, the counter argument that the American military and government had is that even if they didn't create the atomic bomb, it would've still been created elsewhere so they might as well be the first ones to make it. But should such sensitive knowledge that could potentially destroy humanity be sought after even if others might seek this knowledge
