This image is a photograph taken in 1945 of General Leslie Groves and J. Robert Oppenheimer, the fathers of the Manhattan Project, they are seen on the ground zero of the Trinity Test where the first atomic bomb has been tested, in New Mexico. In an effort to stop the war with Japan, the Americans decided to create a weapon of mass destruction but the consequence of making such weapon would be other nations could use it for control and can lead nuclear Armageddon, the counter argument that the American military and government had is that even if they didn't create the atomic bomb, it would've still been created elsewhere so they might as well be the first ones to make it. But should such sensitive knowledge that could potentially destroy humanity be sought after even if others might seek this knowledge.

This next photograph is a psychiatric hospital where illegal human experimentation by the CIA were taking place, it was part of a project called MK Ultra that intended to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used in interrogations to weaken individuals and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture ~\cite{wiki}. The project, which started in 1953 and continued for more than a decade, was originally intended to make sure the United States government kept up with presumed Soviet advances in mind-control technology ~/cite{[What We Know About the CIA's Midcentury Mind-Control Project | Smart News| Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/what-we-know-about-cias-midcentury-mind-control-project-180962836/)}.
