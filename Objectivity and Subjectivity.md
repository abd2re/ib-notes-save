# Objectivity and Subjectivity
?
Everything we perceive about the world is perceived through our lenses, so everything we know about the world is our brain's interpretation of the sensory information it receives. 
What are the implications of this for objectivity ?
What is the difference between objective knowledge and subjective knowledge ?
