# Objectivity and Subjectivity
?
Everything we perceive about the world is perceived through our lenses, so everything we know about the world is our brain's interpretation of the sensory information it receives. 
What are the implications of this for objectivity ?
What is the difference between objective knowledge and subjective knowledge ?

Objectivity=::Looking at the world in a detached way that focuses on facts, largely independent of our own personal perspective

Subjectivity=::Looking at the world from a personal point of view, under the influence of feelings and emotions
