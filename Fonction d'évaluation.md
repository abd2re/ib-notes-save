In the Minimax section and the alpha-beta pruning subsection, the search trees had values in which these algorithms operated to have an outcome, but where do we actually get these values in a Connect-4 game ? To process these values we will need an evaluation function that evaluates the state of a board after a move from a player and attributes it an appropriate value that the maximizing and minimizing players can use to find the best moves. Essentially every node in a search tree is the value of a different game state.

Evaluations functions are game specific and can be tunable, for this experiment we will use a simple Connect 4 evaluation function. This evaluation function attributes a weight to all groups of tokens \footnote{A group of tokens are two or more tokens that are vertically, horizontally or diagonally aligned} depending on the number of tokens that are aligned in a group, for each player. The value that will be returned by the evaluation function is the sum of all the maximizing player weights minus the sum of all the minimizing player weights (see formula \ref{}).
$$\text{Eval}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}{w_i}-\sum^{n'}_{i=1}{w_i}$$
- $n$ = number of groups of tokens for the maximizing player
- $n'$ = number of groups of tokens for the minimizing player
- $i$ = index of a group of tokens
- $w$ = weight attributed for a group of tokens (see table {\ref{}})

The reason these weights have been chosen is to emphasize the priority of groups of aligned tokens that have more aligned tokens. Like we see in the table \ref{tab3}, for two aligned tokens, we only give it a score of 1, but for three aligned token, we give it 10 because it can be one token away from victory, and finally for four tokens, we give it a score of 1000 because it is a winning state that is the only thing that matters. Having weights for higher numbers of aligned tokens would be useless because the numbers of aligned tokens needed to win is only four.
