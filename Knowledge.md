##  What is Knowledge ?
Created: 2022-09-28

There is a deep and strong connection between Knowledge and Knower. To establish the connection between knowledge and the knower, its is pragmatic to know that knowledge does not necessarily mean an outcome of critical thinking but it does involve seeking answers to questions. The answers often require evidence however sometimes we make judgements on the information without much effort of scrutinizing and dissecting it. We often believe information as Knowledge at its face value. Remember, that most knowledge is not contestable because it is certain.
