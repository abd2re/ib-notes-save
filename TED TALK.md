# Economic inequality and unemployment
I graduated high school in 2007. I enrolled in a public university (an inexpensive one as far as universities go). My father cosigned my loans as we were not affluent people as he was a carpenter. When the crash in 2008 occured my father, a union member, was layed off for 2 full years. He was unable to back my loans during this uneasy time due to financials. I was forced to drop out prematurely - not due to bad grades, laziness or the inability to comprehend what was in front of me, but rather these slimy greed driven whores. Im 30 now and make a decent living as a laborer however I'd much rather had continued a potential career in medicine than having my body broken down on a daily basis just to survive. My story is 1 of many and in my humble opinion, an entire generation had their potential stolen from them.
