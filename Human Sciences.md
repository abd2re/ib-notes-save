# Human Sciences

1) List as many features as you can that distinguish human beings from other animals
2) Compare your list with a partner, Can you agree on these features ? Why? Why not?
3) As a class, discuss: what are the difficulties with defining the "unique" features of various animals and humans ? How far can we know that particular human characteristics  are distinctive or unique ?
4) Do you need to do some research into this topic to be able to finalise your list ? If so complete your list once you have found out what is known about the similarities and differences between humans and other animals.

## Methods
Our observations are linked to our senses. Our brain interprets and makes sense  of the data it receives through or via sight, sound, taste, touch, smell and our other senses. There are important questions here to evaluate, regarding the reliability of our senses and the scope and accuracy of our observations. 

**The observer effect**
In human and natural sciences there are number of factors that affect us when we are making observations 


1) Think of examples of when your observations have been accurate and when they have let you down. When can we trust our observations ?
2) To what extent can we ever know how people behave and think when they are not being watched or observed ?
