# Interactionist theory
?
It is believed that language development is the result of both innate and environmental factors. This theory suggests that there is a complex interplay between a individual's genetic predispositions and their experience in the world. Interactionist believe that both nature and nurture are both necessary for language acquisition.
*For example, a child is born with predisposition for language learning but must be exposed to language in their environment to fully develop their linguistic ability.*
