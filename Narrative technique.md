# Narrative technique
?
You might ask yourself questions such as who is the story teller or narrator ? To whom is narrator speaking ? Is it a reliable or unreliable narrator ? How does the narrator tell the story ? Which verb tense is used ? Which pronouns are used ? The narrator might retell the events in reported speech or the narrator may act a fly on the wall and use direct speech.
