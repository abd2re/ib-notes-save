Search algorithms to play or even solve board games have been used and developed since the invention of computers. Many board games are complex decisive problems where an action in the present results later when the game ends in the form of a win or lose. Because these board games have so many outcomes, it's very hard for humans to visualize and master the game in a short amount of time /cite{indians}. Search algorithms are an important part of game-playing algorithms and are often used in combination with other AI techniques to create powerful and effective game-playing programs such as Stockfish which is the most powerful chess engine as of the time of this writing. For simpler games like Tic-Tac-Toe, a computer can easily search through all future possibilities and always be able to play the best move. However, for most games like Chess or Go, the state space is far too large to search through by brute force, and the question about playing these games then becomes about how to play them efficiently whilst given restrictions on the search time /cite{3d}. With this information, Connect-4, which will be the game used in this research paper which is not a very complex game, will have increasing grid sizes to augment the complexity of the game to compare the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm and the Optimized Minimax search algorithm at these different levels of complexity.
