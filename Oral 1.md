## Exract brief
Here, in Chapter III, as Bell and Torbert discuss the sheer number of bodies that have turned up, Bell starts to realize that they are dealing with a new kind of criminal, a type he hasn’t encountered before. He always believed that drug dealers were the more contemporary version of the cattle rustlers that his grandfather, also a sheriff, had to deal with, but what Bell has seen so far has made him change his mind. The criminals Bell now faces are a different type. They are not simply trying to make a buck, they’re also willing to inflict a horrifying level of violence and destruction to achieve their goals. Bell says he has never seen anything like these people before, and that is a strong statement coming from a man who fought the Nazis in Europe. These criminals represent the modern face of the drug trade, and as the novel expresses, this brutal industry permeates all levels of society.

## Theme: The Inevitability of Change
_No Country for Old Men_ pits an “old man” who values justice, morality, and lawfulness against a world in which younger men act according to their own codes. Bell specifically addresses the idea of change, expressing his distaste for new morals, fashions, and customs of contemporary society. He continually compares the present time unfavorably to previous ones. Bell’s attitude is not wholly unexpected. In his years as a sheriff, he has had a front-row seat on crime, and he believes that the new type of drug criminal represents a shift toward lawlessness and chaos, which will only worsen. As bad as Chigurh is, he is simply a harbinger of the future. However, while Bell holds a nostalgic vision of the past, other details that emerge show he is romanticizing it to some extent. For instance, Ellis tells him the truth about a relative who was killed by the Native Americans, showing that violence was always a part of American society. It just took a different form in earlier days. Another relative died at the age of seventeen in World War I. The world always outlives the beings that populate it, and the older generation usually is the first to feel out of step.

## What is the point behind No Country for Old Men?
Exemplifying the wonder for purpose and meaning of man's existence, the picture instead makes its readers wallow in their own dread, showing that **the world is going too fast for them to keep up no matter how hard they try**.

Our three characters

### Anton Chigurh 

The antagonist of the novel. Chigurh works with criminals as a hitman and “fixer.” He is a remorseless killer who lacks empathy for his victims. Chigurh is supremely self-confident and at times seems almost omnipotent. He believes that people are fated to certain futures, including to die at his hand, by all the choices they have made.

### Llewelyn Moss 

A Vietnam vet who sets the novel's events into motion. At thirty-six, Moss is a self-sufficient and clever man who makes the fatal mistake of stealing money from drug dealers and returning to the scene to give water to a dying man. Moss shows ingenuity in his flight from Chigurh and the other men chasing him, but ultimately he cannot outrun them. He refuses to bargain with Chigurh to save the life of his wife, Carla Jean.

### Sheriff Ed Tom Bell 

The sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, and protagonist of the novel. At fifty-seven, Bell serves as the sheriff of his community and feels responsible for keeping people safe. To him, the world is changing in ways he can’t keep up with. He believes Chigurh represents a new kind of evil and he leaves his job rather than risk facing someone like him again.
