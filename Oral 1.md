## Brief
Here, in Chapter III, as Bell and Torbert discuss the sheer number of bodies that have turned up, Bell starts to realize that they are dealing with a new kind of criminal, a type he hasn’t encountered before. He always believed that drug dealers were the more contemporary version of the cattle rustlers that his grandfather, also a sheriff, had to deal with, but what Bell has seen so far has made him change his mind. The criminals Bell now faces are a different type. They are not simply trying to make a buck, they’re also willing to inflict a horrifying level of violence and destruction to achieve their goals. Bell says he has never seen anything like these people before, and that is a strong statement coming from a man who fought the Nazis in Europe. These criminals represent the modern face of the drug trade, and as the novel expresses, this brutal industry permeates all levels of society.

## Theme: The Inevitability of Change
_No Country for Old Men_ pits an “old man” who values justice, morality, and lawfulness against a world in which younger men act according to their own codes. Bell specifically addresses the idea of change, expressing his distaste for new morals, fashions, and customs of contemporary society. He continually compares the present time unfavorably to previous ones. Bell’s attitude is not wholly unexpected. In his years as a sheriff, he has had a front-row seat on crime, and he believes that the new type of drug criminal represents a shift toward lawlessness and chaos, which will only worsen. As bad as Chigurh is, he is simply a harbinger of the future. However, while Bell holds a nostalgic vision of the past, other details that emerge show he is romanticizing it to some extent. For instance, Ellis tells him the truth about a relative who was killed by the Native Americans, showing that violence was always a part of American society. It just took a different form in earlier days. Another relative died at the age of seventeen in World War I. The world always outlives the beings that populate it, and the older generation usually is the first to feel out of step.
