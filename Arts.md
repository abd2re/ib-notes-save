	“I found that I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say in any other way—things that I had no words for.”
Georgia O'Keeffe



1. I agree with that quotation.
2. Visual arts like painting.
3. Art can say more things than words. We can find unparalleled beauty in art.
4. This quotation could be linked to Human Sciences, where art can identify nations and ethnic groups, as well as bring people together.
