# Arts
?
The Arts include a range of disciplines including visual arts, theatre, dance, music, film and literature. The ways in which meaning is encoded, evoked and played out in these various forms of representation do not always overlap and may have no exact counterpart elsewhere. The arts, from the sublime to the mediocre (and even the banal) can provide insight and provoke questions about what it means to be human. Art can be made for its own sake, or created with a functionality in mind like a catalyzing social change, conveying overt political or religious messages, and even self-referentially pushing the boundaries of art itself.
The arts is a way a doing something, expressing yourself and accomplishing something.

	“I found that I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say in any other way—things that I had no words for.”
Georgia O'Keeffe



1. I agree with that quotation.
2. Visual arts like painting.
3. Art can say more things than words. We can find unparalleled beauty in art.
4. This quotation could be linked to Human Sciences, where art can identify nations and ethnic groups, as well as bring people together.

**Is artistic knowledge something that cannot be expressed in any other way?**
Artistic knowledge cannot be expressed in any other way because it is a medium that is intangible.

**Does art enlarge what it is possible for us to think and know?**
Art enlarges what is possible for us to think and know because it gives us ideas, and other prospects about what is possible, so art enlarges us our POV.

**Can a work of art have meaning of which the artist themselves is unaware?**
Because art is subjective, the artist can create more than what he intended to do, and viewers can discover things in art.
  
  
**How does knowing more about the social, cultural or historical context of a work of art have an impact on our knowledge of the work itself?**  
Knowing more about the social, cultural or historical context of a work of art have an impact on our knowledge because it gives us additional information of why the work is.
  
**Should your judgments about art be given the same weight as those of an expert?**
I don't think so, expert have a finer taste in art because it's their craft and have additional information about what makes a piece of art better than other.
