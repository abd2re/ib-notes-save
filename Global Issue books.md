Houseboy, written in the form of Toundi's captivating diary,Â discloses his awe of the white world and a web of unpredictable experiences. In the novel, Toundi is a houseboy for the french colonizers who has great relations with his fellows Africans (except his father) who feel compassion and love for him, but has a very submissive relation with the french colonizers, which is based  upon the colon and the colonized. But how is Toundi's position as a servant perceived by other characters, and how does this affect Toundi's own feeling of self and belonging? To answer this we will see his perception through the lenses of Father Gilbert, a catholic missionnaire, and Madame, the commandant's wife.

Father Gilbert is the local priest who hires Toundi to be his houseboy. He sees Toundi's role as a servant in purely functional terms. To him, Toundi is a tool to help him with his daily tasks, and his worth is measured by his ability to perform those tasks well. Father Gilbert is not interested in Toundi's personal aspirations or struggles, and he does not take the time to get to know Toundi as a person. This impersonal attitude makes Toundi feel like he is not valued as an individual and reinforces his sense of social isolation.

Madame is the wife of the Commandant, the highest-ranking colonial official in the area. She views Toundi's role as a servant in a more complex way. She recognizes that Toundi is a human being with feelings, and she tries to treat him with kindness and empathy. However, she is still part of the colonial power structure, and she cannot fully empathize with Toundi's experiences as a black man in a white-dominated society. Her good intentions are undermined by the fact that she is part of the system that oppresses Toundi and other Africans. This leads Toundi to feel conflicted about his relationship with Madame, as he appreciates her kindness but also resents her for being part of the oppressive system. Because Toundi is later on viewed as a person standing in judgement by all sides of the affair of Madame and M. Moreau, he faces the venomous side of Madame that starts to see Toundi as a virus who needs to be wiped out.

Overall, Toundi's experiences with these two characters show how his role as a servant is viewed through different lenses depending on the person. This impacts his own sense of identity and belonging, as he struggles to reconcile his position as a servant with his aspirations for personal growth and social equality. He also realizes that the social hierarchy of colonialism is arbitrary and unjust, and he begins to question his place in it.
