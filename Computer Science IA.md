## Idea: School event planner
Students or teachers would be able to set up events like revision sessions, tutoring sessions, school tournaments, school charity events and more... Other students can then also enlist in these events and the organiser would be able to see the list of people joining.
- Users have to sign up or log in to be able to use the features
- Users can create an event, and see the list of events he/she created
- Users can see the list of active events and join them
- Users can see the list of events they joined
- Event admin can see the people enlisting in their event and set a maximum number of people
