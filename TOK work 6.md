## Are there outside factors that affect knowledge construction in the arts and mathematics ?

External factors can have an impact on knowledge production in both the arts and mathematics.

External factors including cultural values, historical contexts, social norms, and political influences can affect how artists create and view their work. For instance, particular styles or subjects may be promoted or discouraged based on the present political or cultural climate, and this can have an impact on the choices artists make in their work. Access to materials, teaching, and training can also have an impact on how artists learn their skills and knowledge.

The way knowledge is created in mathematics can be influenced by external variables including society expectations, cultural biases, and educational procedures. For instance, how mathematics is taught in schools may have an impact on how pupils perceive and engage with the material. Moreover, cultural prejudices and preconceptions may have an influence on how different viewpoints are represented and included in mathematics, which may have an impact on how new ideas and information are developed.

Overall, external variables can have a big impact on how the fields of mathematics and the arts build knowledge. To encourage a more equitable and inclusive approach to learning and knowledge growth in these domains, it is critical to acknowledge and address these concerns.
