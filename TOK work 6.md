# Is knowledge in the arts invented or discovered?
## Provide an argument that artistic knowledge is discovered and describe a work of art as an example to support this.

## Are there outside factors that affect knowledge construction in the arts and mathematics ?
External factors including cultural values, historical contexts, social norms, and political influences can affect how artists create and view their work. For instance, particular styles or subjects may be promoted or discouraged based on the present political or cultural climate, and this can have an impact on the choices artists make in their work. Access to materials, teaching, and training can also have an impact on how artists learn their skills and knowledge.

The way knowledge is created in mathematics can be influenced by external variables including society expectations, cultural biases, and educational procedures. For instance, how mathematics is taught in schools may have an impact on how pupils perceive and engage with the material. Moreover, cultural prejudices and preconceptions may have an influence on how different viewpoints are represented and included in mathematics, which may have an impact on how new ideas and information are developed.

Overall, external variables can have a big impact on how the fields of mathematics and the arts build knowledge. To encourage a more equitable and inclusive approach to learning and knowledge growth in these domains, it is critical to acknowledge and address these concerns.

## Do the methods by which knowledge is assessed affect the extent to which individuals can make a contribution in the arts and mathematics?
Traditional methods of evaluation in the arts, such as standardized examinations or assessments focused on technical proficiency or adherence to accepted standards, may not always accurately reflect a person's creative potential or capacity for innovation. This may result in a limited view of what constitutes creative skill and restrict possibilities for individuals who do not meet the predetermined standards. On the other hand, more open-ended kinds of assessment, such peer assessments or portfolio reviews, can enable a wider variety of viewpoints and can better find those with special abilities and potential.

Similar to how multiple-choice tests and standardized examinations may not accurately reflect a person's problem-solving skills or capacity for critical and creative thought, traditional methods of evaluation in mathematics may fall short.

These kinds of evaluations could also perpetuate cultural prejudices and help explain why some groups are underrepresented in mathematics. Alternate assessment methods, including project-based evaluations or group problem-solving exercises, can offer a more thorough assessment of a person's skills and can promote a more inclusive approach to learning and knowledge creation.

## Do the ways in which arts and mathematics are created (or produced) make them conducive or resistant to collaboration? Are individual perspectives valued in mathematics and art?
Whether or not mathematics and the arts are collaboratively friendly depends on how they are developed or produced. Individual viewpoints are, however, widely appreciated in both disciplines.

Collaboration in the arts can take on a variety of shapes, including collaborative projects, group performances, or multidisciplinary partnerships. The creation of a unified piece requires the efforts of many people in some creative disciplines, such as theater or dance. Others, like painting or sculpture, might be more solitary in nature and depend on the creativity and talent of the individual artist. Yet, cooperation in the arts may result in fresh viewpoints, original concepts, and cutting-edge methods for producing art.

Collaboration is a key component of research and problem-solving in mathematics. Teams of researchers frequently collaborate in mathematics research to create new ideas, resolve challenging issues, and test mathematical models. Making advances in the subject may depend on a collaborative team's ability to bring a variety of viewpoints and skill sets together. Individual viewpoints and insights, however, are also highly appreciated in mathematics since they may result in novel strategies for problem-solving and the advancement of mathematical knowledge.

## Does collaboration result in knowledge that is more certain or valuable than individually created knowledge?
Since many viewpoints and skill sets are brought to bear on an issue, cooperation can occasionally result in more certain information. This can assist to uncover and remedy flaws, biases, or oversights. Also, as it may incorporate a greater variety of experiences and insights than solo knowledge development, collaborative knowledge creation can be more thorough and inclusive.

Cooperation can also provide new ideas, methods, or processes that might not have been achievable through solo efforts, which can lead to the creation of more useful information. Teams that work together often produce more creative and significant results because they may draw from a variety of backgrounds and specialties. Building networks of knowledge makers and collaborators through collaboration can create new options for knowledge acquisition, application, and sharing. It's vital to remember, though, that cooperation isn't always advantageous or necessary for knowledge generation.

Individual knowledge generation could be preferable in some circumstances, especially if the issue at hand is simple to solve or calls for a particular skill set. Moreover, groupthink or power imbalances that might stifle innovation and knowledge development can result from cooperation.
