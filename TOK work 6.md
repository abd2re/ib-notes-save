## Are there outside factors that affect knowledge construction in the arts and mathematics ?
In both the arts and mathematics, knowledge construction can be impacted by external circumstances.

The way artists create and perceive their work can be influenced by external variables such as cultural values, historical settings, social standards, and political pressures. For instance, depending on the current political or cultural atmosphere, certain styles or subjects may be encouraged or discouraged, and this can have an effect on the decisions artists make in their work. The methods in which artists acquire their abilities and knowledge can also be influenced by access to tools, instruction, and training.
