Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization of the Minimax search algorithm. Before diving in the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm we will define what "pruning" in Alpha-beta pruning means. The word ‘pruning’ means cutting down branches and leaves. With this Alpha-beta pruning is nothing but the pruning of useless branches in decision trees \cite{ab}, in this case, the pruning of useless branches in a Minimax search algorithm. Like we said in the Minimax section, the search tree becomes extremely complex as the search depth increases, some superfluous branches in that tree add to the complexity of the search algorithm. Alpha-beta pruning helps delete these branches that saves the computer from examining the entire tree \cite{ab}. To be able to know what branches of the search algorithm to prune, we will need two threshold parameters $\alpha$ (alpha) and $\beta$ (beta). These values represent the worst-case scenario for each player. The value of $\alpha$ is initially set at $-\infty$ and will update to the **highest value** every time it's the turn of the maximizing player and the value of the $\beta$ is initially set at $\infty$ and will update to the **lowest value** every time it's the turn of the minimizing player. The condition to prune a branch or a sub-tree\footnote{A sub-tree is a subset of a larger tree containing branches} is when $\alpha \geq \beta$, because every higher values $\alpha$ can have in the maximizing player sub-tree will be useless because the minimizing player has already found a move that would be more advantageous for him, this works the opposite way around too, every lower values $\beta$ can have in the minimizing player sub-tree will be useless because the maximizing player has a found a move that would be more advantageous for him. It is important to note that the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are passed up while backtracking because the Minimax search algorithm uses Depth-first search to traverse the tree (see figure \ref{abtree}).

In the figure \ref{abtree} we can see that it's the same Minimax search tree that we had in the previous section, but this time the second minimizing player node has chosen 3 instead of 1, pruning the other 2 nodes because even if the minimizing player finds lower values than 3, the maximizing player has already found a superior value 4 which is superior to 3 so further research down the minimizing player path would be a waste of time.

The amount of branches pruned by alpha-beta pruning depends on the ordering of the values. Worst ordering occurs when the best values for the maximizing player and the minimizing player are at the end, which means the best values are at the right of the tree, because of that Minimax with $\alpha \beta$ pruning behaves as a normal Minimax search algorithm by searching all nodes, in which the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(b^m)$. Ideal ordering, which means that the best values are always first which means they occur on the left side of the tree, in this optimal case Minimax with $\alpha \beta$ pruning will have a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(b^{m/2})$. The explanation for why it's $\mathcal{O}(b^{m/2})$ in an ideal ordering scenario is because essentially all the first player's values must be examined to find the best one, but for each, **only** the best the second player's move is needed to refute all but the first (and best) player move \cite{wiki}, putting it simply, Minimax with $\alpha \beta$ pruning will skip every two level.
In almost all every Minimax search tree with $\alpha \beta$ pruning, the ordering of the values will be neither worst or ideal but somewhere in the middle. We could order the moves (or values) to be ideal with the help of different heuristic functions but this out of the scope for this paper.

We can see that in table \ref{tab:table2} that the Minimax search algorithm with $\alpha \beta$ pruning even without ideal ordering traverses a lot less nodes than a standard Minimax search algorithm as the level of depth search (ply) increases in Connect 4. With this information, we can assume that for the same number of traversed node, Minimax with $\alpha \beta$ can go into a much further level of depth than normal Minimax.
