Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization of the Minimax search algorithm. Before diving in the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm we will define what "pruning" in Alpha-beta pruning means. The word ‘pruning’ means cutting down branches and leaves. With this Alpha-beta pruning is nothing but the pruning of useless branches in decision trees \cite{ab}, in this case, the pruning of useless branches in a Minimax search algorithm. Like we said in the Minimax section
