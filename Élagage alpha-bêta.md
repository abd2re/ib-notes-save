Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization of the Minimax search algorithm. Before diving in the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm we will define what "pruning" in Alpha-beta pruning means. The word ‘pruning’ means cutting down branches and leaves. With this Alpha-beta pruning is nothing but the pruning of useless branches in decision trees \cite{ab}, in this case, the pruning of useless branches in a Minimax search algorithm. Like we said in the Minimax section, the search tree becomes extremely complex as the search depth increases, some superfluous branches in that tree add to the complexity of the search algorithm. Alpha-beta pruning helps delete these branches that saves the computer from examining the entire tree \cite{ab}. To be able to know what branches of the search algorithm to prune, we will need two threshold parameters $\alpha$ (alpha) and $\beta$ (beta). These values represent the worst-case scenario for each player. The value of $\alpha$ is initially set at $-\infty$ and will update to the **highest value** every time it's the turn of the maximizing player and the value of the $\beta$ is initially set at $\infty$ and will update to the **lowest value** every time it's the turn of the minimizing player. The condition to prune a branch or a sub-tree\footnote{A sub-tree is a subset of a larger tree containing branches} is when $\alpha \geq \beta$, because every higher values $\alpha$ can have in a minimizing player sub-tree will be useless because the minimizing player has already found a move that would be more disadvantageous for the maximizing player elsewhere. It is important to note that the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are passed up while backtracking because the Minimax search algorithm uses Depth-first search to traverse the tree (see figure \ref{}).
