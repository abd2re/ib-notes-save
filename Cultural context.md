# Cultural context
?
The cultural context of a text helps the reader understand what is happening and where. It is made up of several factors including setting or location, background, cultures, beliefs, and community. Each of these items affects how the reader looks at and understanding what is happening in that text. 
For example to understand the plot of the book "To kill a mocking bird" by Lee Harper, the reader must think about where the story is taking place (setting or location), when the story is taking place (year or time), who is involved (characters), and what values and beliefs those characters have. The setting of the book is in the racially divided deep south of the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s. The main character Atticus Finch is a lawyer and also a widowed father of two children. Mr. Finch is called upon to defend a negro who is accused of raping a white woman. Knowing the cultural context of the book makes to understand better the plot and what Mr. Finch is doing. In this way cultural context becomes just as important to understanding the plot of the novel as is knowing the about characters and the point of views the story is being told.
