# Variable types
-   `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
-   `double` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
-   `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
-   `string` - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
-   `bool` - stores values with two states: true or false

- A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10:
```c++
float f1 = 35e3;  
double d1 = 12E4;  
cout << f1;  
cout << d1;
```

- you can use ASCII values to display certain characters:
```c++
char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67;  
cout << a;  
cout << b;  
cout << c;
```
