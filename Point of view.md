1. In the first person point of view the writer uses the word I when writing. You as the writer gets to read the story from the perspective of one person (The Narrator). When the narrator shares his or her thoughts of what is happening, he or she has a limited point of view because the story is only coming from that person's perspective. First point of view is usually used in autobiographical or personal writings such as journals.
2. In the second person point of view the writer uses the pronouns 'you' or 'your' which generally refers to reader. It is most often used for instruction manuals and lessons, where the writer directly refers to the reader. An author may also choose to write in a second person's point of view to purposely draw the reader into the story. Also it is not seen as often as first or third person, second person point of view can be a very effective type of writing when the writer has a a specific purpose in mind. 
3. In the third person point of view the writer uses the pronouns 'he', 'she' or 'it' from either an omniscient perspective or a limited perspective. Using third person omniscient, the writer takes on God's eye's perspective and shares information about all characters and all the actions taking place. The third person limited point of view follows the perspective of one person. As a reader you know you are reading third person omniscient when the writer lets you know what is going on inside the minds of multiple characters in the text. In third person limited, the writer lets you inside the mind of only one character. Most academic writing is written in third person.
