# Who is the Knower ?
Created: 2022-10-12

# Introduction: Real life situation
Question:
1. To what extent can you know yourself ? In TOK we look at what each individual knower brings to the process of knowing. How we might contribute to the array of knowledge that humankind has access to. We will be interested on how we can best try to avoid deceiving ourselves or being deceived by others. We will examine where our current knowledge comes from and what has influenced you to think the way you do. Also we will be challenged to identify and question some of our assumptions and biases and to raise our awareness of the extent to which who we are shapes what we know
2. In what contexts is it possible for others to know you better than you know yourself ?

The question who is the knower has occupied the minds of philosophers and great thinkers for thousands of years, and is perhaps no closer to a definitive answer than it has ever been. Yet if we cannot know who we are as knowers, how can we know anything.
