# Who is the Knower ?
Created: 2022-10-12

# Introduction: Real life situation
Question:
1. To what extent can you know yourself ? In TOK we look at what each individual knower brings to the process of knowing
2. In what contexts is it possible for others to know you better than you know yourself ?

The question who is the knower has occupied the minds of philosophers and great thinkers for thousands of years, and is perhaps no closer to a definitive answer than it has ever been. Yet if we cannot know who we are as knowers, how can we know anything.
