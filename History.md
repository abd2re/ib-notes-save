# History
?
- History is "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, especially human affairs." (OECD)
- It is important to understand the past in order to appreciate our place and context now, in time and space.

Why do we pursue knowledge and understanding of the past ?
We might beginning by saying it's the study of the past. However the answer is more complicated than that. History once focused almost exclusively on telling the stories of kings and queens, great leaders, military campaigns, wars and politics. There has been a significant shift in focus, regarding the topics, [[Scope]], and modern methodology. Whereas historians might specialize in the 20th century. In addition history does not exist as a discipline in isolation, historians might collaborate with experts in other areas of knowledge and borrow from the methodology of other disciplines in order to develop related subject areas, such as art history, economic history.

How can we know about the past ?
- People know what happened in the past byÂ looking at things from the past including sources (like books, newspapers, and letters) and artifacts (like pottery, tools, and human or animal remains.)

**Pluralistic history**:: Accepting that there are various different perspectives that may be justified, and multiple possible accounts of the past.

1) We have very close interpretation of the stories
2) Our memory, what we were doing during this period.
3) We have a clearer idea of this period and have an easier time to reconstruct the timeline of events that occurred
4) Knowledge of the past is possible because we have people that had that experience of living it and we have to take in account their sayings and other historical proofs.

**Pluralistic approach**:: There is, of course, no easy way for us to gain certain knowledge of the past, no escape from our own prejudices and achieve a god's eye view of history. Since history has often been used to promote the interest of dominants nations. It is not surprising that some people are suspicious of the official version of the truth. In a multicultural world, one might argue that textbooks should reflect the experiences not only of elites but also of groups such as women and ethnic minorities. Indeed, rather than thinking of history in the singular, it might be better to think in terms of histories. We have to explore the past from a variety of perspectives.
