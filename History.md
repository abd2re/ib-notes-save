# History
?
- History is "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, especially human affairs." (OECD)
- It is important to understand the past in order to appreciate our place and context now, in time and space.

**Why do we pursue knowledge and understanding of the past ?**
We might beginning by saying it's the study of the past. However the answer is more complicated than that. History once focused almost exclusively on telling the stories of kings and queens, great leaders, military campaigns, wars and politics. There has been a significant shift in focus, regarding the topics, [[Scope]], and modern methodology. Whereas historians might specialize in the 20th century. In addition history does not exist as a discipline in isolation, historians might collaborate with experts in other areas of knowledge and borrow from the methodology of other disciplines in order to develop related subject areas, such as art history, economic history.

**How can we know about the past ?**
- People know what happened in the past byÂ looking at things from the past including sources (like books, newspapers, and letters) and artifacts (like pottery, tools, and human or animal remains.)

**Pluralistic history**:: Accepting that there are various different perspectives that may be justified, and multiple possible accounts of the past.

1) We have very close interpretation of the stories
2) Our memory, what we were doing during this period.
3) We have a clearer idea of this period and have an easier time to reconstruct the timeline of events that occurred
4) Knowledge of the past is possible because we have people that had that experience of living it and we have to take in account their sayings and other historical proofs.

**Pluralistic approach**:: There is, of course, no easy way for us to gain certain knowledge of the past, no escape from our own prejudices and achieve a god's eye view of history. Since history has often been used to promote the interest of dominants nations. It is not surprising that some people are suspicious of the official version of the truth. In a multicultural world, one might argue that textbooks should reflect the experiences not only of elites but also of groups such as women and ethnic minorities. Indeed, rather than thinking of history in the singular, it might be better to think in terms of histories. We have to explore the past from a variety of perspectives.

There are many reasons for pursuing historical knowledge. We can justify history on various grounds, including that it gives us a shared/collective memory, enriching our understanding of human nature, is a defense against propaganda and can provide a range of perspectives.

## History gives us a shared memory
History gives us a shared memory. You can know a person if you know something about his history, you can also know a country if you know something about its history and collective national memories. If you are to have informed opinions about current affairs, and your judgements about other countries are to go beyond mere prejudice, then a knowledge of history is indispensable. Education system will take a peculiar approach to the teaching of history. For example a school history textbook might shape a student's sense of identity, and a collective national memory. Textbooks written about the same historical person or events may take different approaches.

The key issue is who interprets the collective national memory for today, and how it is represented. These issues have significant implications for knowledge and knowing,

## History enriches our understanding of human nature 
History enriches our understanding of human nature by showing us what human beings have thought and done in a wide variety of circumstances. History reminds us that human behavior can never be fully explained in terms of neat and tidy models. If that is the case, than we might agree with the historians R. G. Collingwood (1889-1943) who suggested that if you want to know yourself and other people better, you might want to pursue historical knowledge. My answer is that history for human self-knowledge... Knowing yourself means knowing what you can do;  and since nobody knows what he can do until he tries, the only clue to what man can do is what man has done.
The value of history, then, is that it teaches us of what man has done and thus what man is.
