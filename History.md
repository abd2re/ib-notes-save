# History
?
- History is "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, especially human affairs." (OECD)
- It is important to understand the past in order to appreciate our place and context now, in time and space.

Why do we pursue knowledge and understanding of the past ?
We might beginning by saying it's the study of the past. However the answer is more complicated than that. History once focused almost exclusively on telling the stories of kings and queens, great leaders, military campaigns, wars and politics. There has been a significant shift in focus, regarding the topics, [[Scope]], and modern methodology. Whereas historians might specialize in the 20th century. In addition history does not exist as a discipline in isolation, historians might collaborate with experts in other areas of knowledge and borrow from the methodology of other disciplines in order to develop related subject areas, such as art history, economic history.

How can we construct knowledge as part of a study of history.
