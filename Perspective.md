# Perspective
?
**The word perspective can be defined as a point of view, a particular way of seeing or considering something.**
All of us, as knowers, bring our own perspective to every situation from the people and places we like to the political opinion we hold. If you think back to the things you liked or disliked when you were very young, you would probably have very different opinions of them now.

As our perspectives change, so too do our taste and opinions. Sometimes, our personal perspective can help us to understand others, at other times, it can prevent us from understand or even wanting to understand their opinions.
